            <h6>The book is on it’s way. Here’s what two of my favorite poets say about it:</h6>
            <br/>
            <blockquote>The “lost coast” of America has a brilliant new troubadour. Steeped in the cinematic and musical mythmaking of our country – from hip to traditional – Joshua Butts is part James Wright and part Chrissie Hynde, and the Midwest of his poetry is as poignant, generous, driven, and electric as the work of those great artists. As William Carlos Williams said, “The pure products of America / go crazy–” and this remarkable young poet adds: “Keep telling stories… and resist thinking it’s nice only here. / In many places there’s still plenty of wildness.”
            <cite>David St. John, author of The Auroras: New Poems</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <br />
            <blockquote>“Hope is the drag,” writes Joshua Butts in this stellar debut collection, leading the reader on a tour of striving and ruin from Alaska to Appalachia. Butts is an astute observer of American bitterness (“A niece wants a ring off a dead lady’s hand. / She has a right.), writing poems of starkness, biting wit, and stripped-down spirituality. Through scrap yards, rough rivers, and the dark interior of the movies, New to the Lost Coast expertly guides the reader with a grip both expansive and tight. 
            <cite>Natalie Shapero, author of No Object</cite>
